# Bubble Chart of Disability Categories Static Visualization 
HOW-TO:
- Have 'summaries_ready.csv', index.html, and main.js in the same folder.
- Run index.html in a local browser.

FEATURES:
- Loads data from CSV
- Force-directed bubble layout (with dynamic or static version possible)
- Automatic text scaling with bubble size
  
ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Adjusted poems to better fit dataset and adjust scope of project
- Will still have the ability to further "pop" bubbles to further explore demographics in the dynamic implementation
